Digital Thermostat-
The provided code for the digital thermostat system simulation in C++ demonstrates knowledge and skills related to software development aspects of embedded systems. It showcases proficiency in programming logic, simulation techniques, and software design principles. However, it does not directly demonstrate skills in low-level programming or hardware interaction, which are typically associated with embedded systems development. To truly showcase embedded systems development skills, access to physical hardware and utilization of appropriate microcontrollers or hardware platforms would be necessary.

Certainly! Here's an overview of the instructions and explanations that should be included in the README file for building and running the simulation of the digital thermostat system:
## Digital Thermostat System Simulation -This project is a simulation of a digital thermostat system implemented in C++. It provides a user interface to set the desired temperature and observe temperature readings, along with a control logic that adjusts a virtual heating or cooling system to maintain the temperature as close to the desired setting as possible.
### Building the Simulation-To build the digital thermostat system simulation, please follow these steps:
1. Ensure that you have a C++ compiler installed on your system. This project is compatible with popular compilers such as GCC and Clang.
2. Download or clone the project repository to your local machine.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
4. Compile the source code using the following command:
   g++ -o thermostat main.cpp
 5. The compilation process will generate an executable file named `thermostat` in the project directory.
### Running the Simulation
To run the digital thermostat system simulation, please follow these steps:
1. Make sure that the compilation process has been completed successfully, and the `thermostat` executable is available in the project directory.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the simulation by executing the following command:
    ./thermostat
   
4. The simulation will start running, displaying the current temperature, desired temperature, and the state of the heating or cooling system. The temperature readings will be simulated, and the heating or cooling system will adjust accordingly.
5. To set the desired temperature, follow the on-screen prompts. Enter the desired temperature when prompted, and the thermostat system will respond accordingly.
6. The simulation will continue running until you manually terminate it by pressing Ctrl+C (or equivalent) in the terminal or command prompt.
### Additional Notes
- The simulation generates random temperature values within a specified range for demonstration purposes since actual hardware access is not available. You can modify the temperature range and simulation logic in the code to suit your requirements.
- Feel free to explore and modify the source code to add additional features, improve the simulation, or experiment with different control algorithms.
- If you encounter any issues or have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to contact the project maintainer.
That covers the basic instructions for building and running the digital thermostat system simulation. You can further enhance the README file by providing details about the code structure, design decisions, and any other relevant information.
